The Game
The game allows the player to go through a dungeon crawl. There are random chances whether an event happens, similar to Oregon Trail styled games.
Such events might be a battle with a monster (of which there are 8), a prompt asking for a choice (jump the chasm, or find a way around), or simple good fortune of finding gold.
The player has 4 party members to choose from. Once a party member has died, there is no way to bring them back, but certain prompts can heal the living ones.
The player's goal is to get to the end with as much gold as they can.



Playing the Game:
Start the game up

At the top is your progress in the dungeon.
The info on the left is the health of various party members.
In the lower right is the amount of gold you have obtained.

The marker will progress through the dungeon until an event occurs.
You can react to these events with the space key (next, OK or exit), and the number buttons 1-4

In combat, each party member has a number, 1-4 corresponding to them, from top to bottom.
