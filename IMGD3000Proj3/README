The program is built with 'make' , and run with './game'

The tests can be accessed by commenting or uncommenting lines of the main function in game.cpp
Each function has an explanation on what it tests, and output of the function is found as visuals shown on screen, or as part of the dragonfly log file.

The program must be made after each uncommenting. Uncommenting all at once will only result in the final command being shown in the log file.

This program was created on the CCC linux machines, and builds on those machines.
